// NO SERIF, NO BUNDLED FACE — 2026-08-22, the operator's SECOND font decision
// of that day (docs/emerald-v2/DECISIONS.md D5's second dated note). It
// reversed that morning's Playfair Display bundling in full AND retired the
// platform serif (Georgia on iOS, `serif` elsewhere) that had predated it:
// the whole app sets in the platform's system sans.
//
// This test is the INVERSION of the Playfair fence that stood here. Inverted
// rather than deleted, because a deleted fence protects nothing — this one
// goes red the moment a serif family name or a bundled .ttf comes back.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT VACUOUS. Four halves, none a restatement of another:
//
//   1. EXECUTED. Both token surfaces are RUN and their resolved `fontFamily`
//      read. Repointing any role at a face — a bare literal, a Platform.select
//      serif, a re-added `displayBold` token — fails here, in the resolved
//      value, not in a source pattern.
//   2. WEIGHTS, AS VALUES. With nothing bundled iOS picks the face from
//      `fontWeight`, so the heading weights are load-bearing again. They are
//      pinned to their exact values rather than merely "defined": dropping one
//      renders that heading at normal weight, which is invisible in a diff and
//      obvious on a device.
//   3. DERIVED, NOT ENUMERATED. Every `fontFamily:` in the app tree is found by
//      scanning, and its right-hand side must be one of the two tokens or
//      `undefined` — an ALLOW-LIST, so a serif in a file this test has never
//      heard of still fails, and so does a newly-added `fonts.displayBold`
//      (the word boundary rejects it).
//   4. THE ASSET AND THE LOADER. No .ttf/.otf anywhere under assets/, and no
//      expo-font import, `useFonts` call or font render-gate left in App.tsx.
