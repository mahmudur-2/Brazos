# BRAZOS_BUILD_STATE
Updated: 2026-08-08

## Current phase
Phase 0 — Repository audit. **COMPLETE.** Next exact task: Phase 1 — Design
system foundation. Start from `docs/emerald-v2/DESIGN_SYSTEM_STATUS.md`'s
"What Phase 1 genuinely needs to build vs. what already exists" section.

## Phase log
- [x] 0 audit · commit `<pending — see final Phase 0 commit hash>` · Repository
  audit executed per §B; two deliverable docs produced
  (`SCREEN_CROSSWALK.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM_STATUS.md`), executive summary
  rewritten with KEEP/FIX/CONSOLIDATE/REMOVE/ADD, all VERIFY tags resolved,
  `verify-schema.mjs` run clean, `f3e75d0` evaluated (needed, not obsolete,
  not cherry-picked — see Known issues). Zero application-code changes.
- [ ] 1 design system · [ ] 2 mode/nav · [ ] 3 data ·
  [ ] 4 post · [ ] 5 hire · [ ] 6 lifecycle · [ ] 7 messaging ·
  [ ] 8 discovery · [ ] 9 profiles · [ ] 10 reviews · [ ] 11 earnings ·
  [ ] 12 notifications · [ ] 13 hardening
(mark with commit hash + one-line note when done)

## Locked
Screens 01–07, 48. Frozen PWA. emerald-v2 references. Confirmed this pass:
Customer Home (`screens/HomeScreen.tsx`) and Worker Home
(`screens/BrowseJobsScreen.tsx`) are both full Emerald redesigns (hero art,
serif display type, live data feeds, mode-switch pill wired to
`useModeTransition()`), genuinely locked-worthy — not placeholders.

## Resolved VERIFY items
- router: **react-navigation** (`@react-navigation/native` + `bottom-tabs` + `native-stack`)
- server-state layer: **none exists** — no TanStack Query or equivalent; per-hook fetch/refetch/realtime pattern throughout (`useJob`, `useJobDetail`, `useMyJobsHub`, `useConversations`, etc.)
- radius search: **real Haversine RPC** (`jobs_within_radius()`, `supabase/phase41_jobs_within_radius.sql`) against `job_locations` exact coords; older `job_hotspots()`/`jobs_in_cell()` grid-cell RPCs kept in parallel for map density, untouched
- media tables: **per-domain**, not polymorphic (`jobs.photos`/`videos`/`completion_photos`/`completion_videos` as jsonb columns; `reviews.photos`; `portfolio_items.photo_url`)
- scheduled-function pattern: **on-read-check only** — no edge-function/cron pattern exists anywhere in the repo; the master plan's 72h auto-approve will need to be built as an on-read check first
- nav-bar bug: **confirmed still live** in 6 of 7 originally-patched screens (`AdminReportsScreen`, `CellJobsScreen`, `PostJobScreen`, `ProfileReviewsScreen`, `WorkerProfileScreen`, `WorkerSearchScreen`); `BrowseJobsScreen` alone is already correct. Fix in Phase 2.
- auth implementation: email/password (`lib/AuthContext.tsx`) is the only real session-creating path; phone auth is a tested mock (`lib/phoneAuth/`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_PHONE_AUTH_MODE` env var), real Supabase phone provider coded but dormant/unprovisioned
- messaging/realtime: real, via Supabase Realtime `postgres_changes` on `messages`, per-conversation + inbox-level channels; chat media private, signed-URL-resolved (6h TTL)
- payment implementation: **does not exist at any layer** — no table, ledger, provider, or real UI; one unbacked "Protected payment" marketing badge on `WelcomeScreen` flagged as a product/copy gap
- generated DB types: **do not exist** — `jobs.status` etc. typed as plain `string`; raw string-literal status comparisons throughout `lib/`
- open-job bid counteroffer vs. job_requests mechanism: **still two separate systems**, confirmed unchanged; unification decision remains open, not made by this audit
- reports table vs. new dispute table: **still unresolved**, unchanged from 2026-08-04
- saved workers presence: **still UNKNOWN** — check before Phase 5/9

## Key decisions (dated one-liners)
- 2026-08-08: `v2` (not `mainexpo`) is the authoritative BRAZOS V2 development
  branch — created from `feature/emerald-v2-fidelity` HEAD, which contains
  the real Emerald redesign work; `mainexpo` is an older baseline missing it.
  User-authorized override of the prior `CLAUDE.md` mainexpo-only rule.
- 2026-08-08: `f3e75d0` (mainexpo's lone unique commit, a safe-area fix) is
  needed but was **not** cherry-picked — its underlying bug still exists in
  6 of 7 originally-patched files, but 2 of those (`PostJobScreen`,
  `WorkerSearchScreen`) have been rewritten enough that the patch itself
  won't cleanly apply. Re-apply the same one-line fix by hand in Phase 2.
- 2026-08-08: the existing customer/worker mode-switch UX
  (`ModeTransitionOverlay`, the Home/Worker Home switch pills) is real,
  polished, user-facing work to preserve and re-home under Phase 2/3's real
  dual-navigator architecture — not a shortcut that reduces Phase 2's scope.
  Phase 2 is still the full structural build (ModeProvider, switchMode(),
  typed param lists, `profiles.active_mode`).

## Migrations applied (verify-schema green)
phase15 through phase39: all confirmed live via `node scripts/verify-schema.mjs`
(clean run, 2026-08-08). phase40/phase41 are not covered by the script
(pre-existing gap, not new) — phase41 (`jobs_within_radius`) is confirmed live
indirectly, since `BrowseJobsScreen`/`WorkerResultsScreen` call it successfully
in the running app per source inspection; not independently re-verified via
the script this pass.

## Known issues
- Nav-bar/safe-area duplicate-bottom-inset bug live in 6 screens (see above) — fix in Phase 2.
- `PostJobScreen` draft state is in-memory only (no `AsyncStorage`) — lost on app kill. Real gap against Phase 4's DoD.
- No scheduling/arrival-window field on `jobs` — confirmed absent (previously only suspected).
- `lib/acceptBidCompatibility.ts`'s `acceptBidWithoutRpc()` fallback (only runs on `PGRST202`, i.e. if `accept_bid` RPC ever drops from PostgREST's schema cache) does a non-atomic read-then-multi-step-update with no row lock — a real TOCTOU race, unlikely to be exercised since the RPC is confirmed live, but untested for concurrency.
- Avatar re-upload with a changed file extension orphans the old storage object (no cleanup call, unlike `deleteJobPhoto` for job photos).
- `WelcomeScreen` shows a "Protected payment" marketing badge; no payment system exists anywhere in the codebase. Flag to user before Phase 4/8.
- `components/SectionHeader.tsx` is dead code (never imported) — left in place per Phase 0 policy, candidate for Phase 13 deletion.

## Gate status
tsc · eslint · verify-schema · mode-smoke · rls-probe : verify-schema=PASS (run 2026-08-08); tsc/eslint not run this pass (no application code changed); mode-smoke N/A (mode-split doesn't exist yet, Phase 2 deliverable); rls-probe not run as a standalone script this pass — RLS posture spot-checked directly against SQL source instead (profiles/jobs/bids/reviews/job_locations grants revoked, notification_outbox/worker_semantic_docs zero-policy, job_locations party-scoped — all confirmed matching documented posture, no discrepancy found).
